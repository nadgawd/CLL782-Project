Please read it carefully:
You may introduce reasonable assumptions to make the problem tractable, but all assumptions MUST be
clearly stated and justified.  Define all variables, parameters, decision variables, and notation explicitly
before  using  them.   You  are  encouraged  to  explore  multiple  problem  formulations,  modeling  choices,
and solution strategies,  drawing inspiration from relevant literature and reliable online resources;  any
external sources consulted MUST be properly cited.
The objective of the assignment is to evaluate bothexplorationandexploitation.  Exploration refers
to the breadth of investigation, creativity in problem formulation, comparison of alternative approaches,
and critical understanding of existing methods.  Exploitation refers to the depth, rigor, and effectiveness
of the final chosen modeling and solution strategy.  Strong exploratory analysis that meaningfully informs
and improves the final solution will be rewarded accordingly.
For presentation, you are strongly encouraged to use visual elements.  This may include clear schemat-
ics,  plots,  flow  diagrams,  or  system-level  illustrations.   Students  may  also  choose  to  build  interactive
visualizations or simple graphical interfaces - such as using Streamlit (https://streamlit.io), Plotly
Dash (https://dash.plotly.com), or similar tools, to demonstrate system behavior, trade-offs, or op-
timization outcomes.  Effective visual communication will be viewed positively as part of good systems
engineering practice.
The broader goal of these projects is to inculcate interdisciplinary thinking, reflecting the reality that real-
world engineering problems often span multiple domains and is difficult to address in isolation.  For mo-
tivation and to gain insight into how optimization problems naturally weave across different application
areas and modeling paradigms, you may refer to the final projects from the Engineering Design Optimiza-
tion course at Stanford University (https://aa222.stanford.edu/projects/past-final-projects/).
## Deliverables:
•Clear formulation of the problem (including decision variables, constraints, and any assumptions)
•Analytical or semi-analytical insights where possible
•Coding in either Python or other programming languages (part of Appendix in report)
•Interpretation of the optimal solution and sensitivity to assumptions
•One report submission before major exam
•A preliminary presentation before mid-sem (tentatively the week of Feb 12-16).
•Final presentation a week before end-sem.

Each report should include a “Declaration of Tool Usage” after the cover page.  This declaration is meant
to encourage honest disclosure of tool use and WILL NOT be used for evaluation.
Declaration of Tool Usage
I declare that in completing this assignment:
2I used an LLM-based tool (e.g.,  Copilot,  ChatGPT, Gemini,  Claude,  Perplexity,  DeepSeek,  etc)
for assistance, as described below.
2I did not use any Large Language Model (LLM)-based tool.
If an LLM-based tool was used, I confirm that:
•I understand the submitted solution fully.
•I can explain and justify every part of my code and reasoning.
•I have verified all results independently.
Name of the tools used:
## Signature:
## Date:
The following mandatory reflection must be addressed briefly both in your report and during the pre-
sentation:
-  What aspect of this assignment did you find most challenging?
-  If you used any automated tool (including LLMs), what errors, limitations, or gaps did you observe,
and how did you refine or improve the outcome?
