Sustainable “Rendezvous” - A Festival Systems Challenge
Context.WhenSanskruti,  a  third-year  chemical  engineering  student  from  West  Champaran  district
in  Bihar,  was  elected  as  the  General  Secretary  (Cultural  Affairs)  at  IIT  Delhi,  she  was  thrilled  by  the
opportunity.   Growing  up  on  the  fringes  of  one  of  India’s  richest  biodiversity  hotspots  -  where  rivers,
forests,  and  wildlife  coexist  in  delicate  balance,  Sanskruti  had  developed  a  strong  respect  for  nature  and
an instinctive understanding of how fragile ecosystems can be.
Upon arriving in Delhi, however, she was struck by the chaos and the enormous environmental footprint
of  human-led  activities  in  metro-cities.   She  realized  that  the  shine,  dazzling  lights,  convenience,  and
spectacle that defined urban life, came at a cost, one that the environment silently but heavily paid.  When
she witnessed the scale of waste generated during IIT Delhi’s renowned cultural festival,Rendezvous-
advertised as Asia’s largest student-run cultural festival - she decided to take an audacious step.
Rather than viewing the festival merely as a logistical challenge, Sanskruti began to see it as a powerful
opportunity.   With  thousands  of  visitors,  including  many  school  students,  she  felt  the  festival  could  go
beyond  entertainment  and  serve  as  a  platform  for  awareness  and  learning.  She  envisioned  Rendezvous
as an event that demonstrates how enjoyment, creativity, and responsibility can coexist - showing young
minds that thoughtful choices can lead to meaningful impact.
As a member of the conscious younger generation, Sanskruti believed that meaningful change would not
come from slogans or social media campaigns alone; one had to be the change to truly see the change.  For
her,sustainability was not about restriction, but about acting responsibly, making informed
decisions, and leading by example.
She  therefore  took  on  the  bold  challenge  of  reimagining  Rendezvous  as  a  truly  sustainable  festival,  one
that  minimizes  waste,  optimizes  resource  use,  and  paints  a  loud,  unmistakable  example  for  others  to
see.  With the support of the Dean (Student Affairs), Sanskruti assembled a Sustainability Task Force, a
diverse team of students from engineering, research, management, and design disciplines - charged with
reimagining how a large-scale cultural event could be planned, executed, and experienced sustainably.
Your  team  is  part  of  this  task  force.   You  have  been  entrusted  with  the  responsibility  tomodel,  ana-
lyze,  and  optimize  key  components  of  the  festival-  from  waste  collection  and  transportation  to
infrastructure planning and procurement decisions - using the tools of optimization and systems thinking.
Module 3.1  Modeling the Problem:  Quantifying Environmental Load
(a)  Define an environmental impact function.  E.g.,E=f(N, S, A), whereN:  number of attendees,
S:  number of food stalls,A:  total event activities (e.g., concerts, performances).
(b)  Do literature review and formulate an expressive model, which could include nonlinear terms (di-
minishing returns, crowding effects).
(c)  Incorporate sub-components withinE, like energy use, waste generation, and emissions.
(d)  Find the unconstrained minimum ofE, i.e., the ideal event scale that minimizes total ecological
footprint.
(e)  Does the objective function need to be modified to better capture the sustainable festival design?
If yes, propose appropriately.  Keep it to the unconstrained formulation in this module.
(f)  Discuss  results  and  draw  your  insights  such  as  trade-offs,  diminishing  returns,  sub-optimal  and
optimal solutions, etc.

Module 3.2  Dustbin Placement and Accessibility
Optimize  waste-bin  placement  to  minimize  average  walking  distance  while  meeting  accessibility  and
budget constraints.
(a)  Formulate real-world bin location and allocation problems using nonlinear constrained optimiza-
tion.
•Objective:  Minimize total walking distance weighted by footfall density.
•Constraints:  Budget limit, bin capacity, coverage requirement.
(b)  Divide the IIT Delhi campus map into several zonesi∈{1, . . . , m}with estimated footfall densities
(e.g.,  people/hr).   Each  zoneican  have  candidate  bin  locationsj∈ {1, . . . , p}(grid  points  or
predefined region)
(c)  There are 3 bin types:t∈ {recyclable, compostable, general}.  Each has a cost (c), service radius
(each bin serves people within a radiusr), and capacity constraint (say in kg).
(d)  Your decision variables can be:
## •y
i,j,t
∈{0,1}:  if bin of typetis placed at candidate locationjwithin zonei
## •a
i,j,t
∈[0,1]:  fraction  of  zoneifootfall  assigned  to  binjof  typet(Assignment/coverage
fraction).
(e)  Solve the constrained optimization problem and report the optimal number and type of bins per
zone.
•You can relax the binary variable to solve the continuous problem first and then you can solve
the original problem, i.e., MINLP.

Module 3.3  Waste Collection and Processing Logistics
Design an efficient waste collection and processing logistics system.  Waste generated in different zones
must  be  transported  to  recycling/processing  centers.   Each  vehicle  and  vendor  has  fixed  and  variable
costs.
(a)  Model the transportation of waste from zonesi={1, . . . , m}to processing centersj∈ {recycling
units, compost pits, landfill}.
•Objective:  Minimize total transportation and processing cost.
•Constraints:  Capacity of vehicles, facilities capacity, waste supply constraint at zonei.
(b)  Facilitiesjhave throughput capacitiesCap
j
and unit processing cost in INR/kg.  Transport cost
per kg from zoneito facilityjcan be modeled ast

## =c

+ per-kg handling.  Feel free
to modify the model.
(c)  Your decision variables can be:
## •x

≥0:  kg of waste from zoneisent to facilityj.
•Number of vehicles for transportation∈Z
## ≥0
•vehicle route used∈{0,1}.  e.g., vehicle 1 starting point→zone 1→zone 3 ...→facilityj
(d)  Solve for optimal vehicle deployment and facility utilization.
(e)  Perform sensitivity analysis to check how results change if waste generation increases by 20%.

## Module 3.4  Water Refill Station Planning
The  festival  adopts  a  reusable  water  bottle  policy  for  all  participants.   To  promote  reusable  bottles,
each festival participant may be given a metallic water bottle, with cost partially recovered through the
festival pass.
(a)  Pickkrefill station locations to serve attendees (minimize walking distance + installation cost)
subject to capacities (you can look for capacity p-median problem).
•Objective:  Minimize walking distance + installation cost
•Constraints:  capacity of refill station
(b)  Candidate location for refill stationj∈{1, . . . , p}.  Demand point comes from zonesi∈{1, . . . , m}
with footfalld(people/hr).  Station installation cost can be considered asf
j
.  service capacity can
be considered ascap
j
(people served per hour).  walking cost can be considered to be proportional
to distance from zone to refill station.
(c)  Your decision variables can be:
## •y
j
∈{0,1}:  refill station atj
## •x
i,j
∈[0,1]:  fraction of zoneifootfall assigned to stationj(Assignment/coverage fraction).
You can make this variable strict binary too{0,1}.
(d)  Solve for optimal number and placement of refill stations.

Module 3.5  Integrated System-Level Model
(a)  Combine the previous modules into a system-level optimization
•Minimize total cost, environmental cost, user inconvenience (average walking distance involved
in using dustbin and refill station)
•Constraints:  Combine all constraints from above modules:  budget, capacities, coverage, ser-
vice radii, logistic feasibility.
(b)  Solve the multi-objective optimization problem and analyze the trade-offs across different objec-
tives.

Optimization is in our DNA –
a “near-perfect” design shaped by millions of years of evolution, and still an ongoing process
Just like Mother Nature, we can optimize continuously – learning, adapting, and improving.
