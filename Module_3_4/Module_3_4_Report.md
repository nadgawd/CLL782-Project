### 1. Introduction
To promote sustainability and reduce single-use plastic, the festival has adopted a reusable water bottle policy. The success of this initiative depends on the convenient availability of water refill stations. Module 3.4 focuses on optimizing the location and number of these stations. The objective is to minimize the combined cost of installation and user inconvenience (walking distance), subject to station capacity constraints, ensuring that attendees can easily refill their bottles without excessive queuing or travel.

### 2. Nomenclature
The variables and parameters used in the mathematical model are defined in Table 1.

**Table 1: Nomenclature Table**

| Symbol | Description | Units | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $i$ | Index for demand zones (footfall locations), $i \in \{1, \dots, m\}$ | - | Index |
| $j$ | Index for candidate refill station locations, $j \in \{1, \dots, p\}$ | - | Index |
| $d_i$ | Footfall / Demand at zone $i$ | persons/hr | Parameter |
| $D_{ij}$ | Walking distance from zone $i$ to candidate location $j$ | meters | Parameter |
| $f_j$ | Fixed installation and operation cost of station at $j$ | INR | Parameter |
| $cap_j$ | Service capacity of station at $j$ | persons/hr | Parameter |
| $C_{walk}$ | Monetary value of walking distance (Time value) | INR/m | Parameter |
| $y_j$ | Binary decision: 1 if station is installed at $j$, 0 otherwise | - | Decision Var |
| $x_{i,j}$ | Fraction of demand from zone $i$ served by station $j$ | - | Decision Var |
| $Z$ | Total Cost (Installation + Walking Inconvenience) | INR | Objective Fn |

### 3. Assumptions and Justifications
1.  **A1: Capacitated P-Median Variant.**
    *   **Justification:** The problem is modeled as a variant of the Capacitated Plant Location Problem (CPLP) or P-Median Problem. We assume the number of stations ($k$) is not strictly fixed but determined by the trade-off between installation cost and walking cost, although the problem statement mentions "Pick k locations", implying $k$ might be fixed or bounded. We treat $f_j$ as the penalty for adding a station.
2.  **A2: Splittable Demand.**
    *   **Justification:** We allow demand from a single zone to be split between multiple stations ($x_{i,j} \in [0,1]$). In reality, users choose the station, but at the aggregate level, this models the probability distribution of users moving to different nearby stations.
3.  **A3: Finite Candidate Set.**
    *   **Justification:** Stations can only be installed at pre-designated feasible locations (e.g., near plumbing lines), not anywhere in continuous space.

### 4. Data Estimation and Context (IIT Delhi Specifics)
To ensure the model is grounded in reality, the following well-supported approximations are used for coefficients:

*   **Scope:** The analysis focuses on the **90-acre high-intensity zone** (OAT, Nalanda, LHC, etc.), with a peak footfall of **40,000 attendees** [Module 3.2].
*   **Water Demand ($d_i$):**
    *   **Per Capita Need:** During high-activity festivals in Delhi's climate, hydration needs are approx. **250 ml/hour** per person.
    *   **Peak Demand:** $40,000 \times 0.25 = 10,000$ Liters/hour total across the zone.
*   **Refill Station Specifications ($j$):**
    *   **Type:** Commercial RO Water Coolers / Water ATM units.
    *   **Capacity ($cap_j$):** Rated cooling/dispensing capacity of **250 Liters Per Hour (LPH)** [1].
        *   *Note:* While taps flow at ~5-8 LPM, cooling capacity is the bottleneck.
    *   **Installation Cost ($f_j$):** Approx **₹75,000 - ₹1,25,000** per unit (Includes machine, plumbing, branding) [2].
*   **Walking Cost ($C_{walk}$):**
    *   **Time Value of Money:** Assuming a student/visitor's time is valued effectively at ₹100/hour.
    *   **Walk Speed:** 80 meters/minute.
    *   **Cost Coefficient:** $\approx$ ₹1.6/min $\approx$ **₹0.02 per meter** of walking. This penalizes long deviations for water.

### 5. Mathematical Model Formulation

The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model.

#### 4.1 Objective Function Construction
We minimize the Total Generalized Cost ($Z$):
1.  **Installation Cost:** Sum of fixed costs for all installed stations.
    $$ C_{install} = \sum_{j=1}^p f_j \cdot y_j $$
2.  **User Inconvenience Cost:** Total weighted walking distance.
    $$ C_{user} = \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^p (d_i \cdot x_{i,j}) \cdot D_{ij} \cdot C_{walk} $$

**Combined Objective:**
$$ Z = \sum_{j=1}^p f_j y_j + \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^p \alpha_{ij} x_{i,j} $$
Where $\alpha_{ij} = d_i D_{ij} C_{walk}$ is the cost coefficient for assigning zone $i$ to $j$.

#### 4.2 Constraints Integration

**1. Demand Satisfaction:**
All attendees in every zone must be served.
$$ \sum_{j=1}^p x_{i,j} = 1, \quad \forall i $$

**2. Station Capacity:**
The total flow assigned to station $j$ cannot exceed its capacity.
$$ \sum_{i=1}^m d_i \cdot x_{i,j} \le cap_j \cdot y_j, \quad \forall j $$
*Note: This constraint also acts as the logical link; if $y_j=0$, capacity is 0, so no flow can be assigned.*

**3. Integer Constraints:**
Stations are either installed or not.
$$ y_j \in \{0, 1\}, \quad \forall j $$

**4. Variable Domains:**
$$ 0 \le x_{i,j} \le 1, \quad \forall i, j $$

### 5. Optimization Analysis

#### 5.1 Complexity and Convexity
This is a classic **NP-hard** combinatorial optimization problem.
*   **Convexity:** The LP relaxation (allowing $0 \le y_j \le 1$) is convex, but the integer restrictions create a non-convex feasible region.
*   **Scale:** With $m$ zones and $p$ candidate sites, we have $p$ binary variables and $m \times p$ continuous variables. For campus-scale problems ($m \approx 50, p \approx 20$), this is easily solvable by Branch-and-Bound algorithms in seconds.

#### 5.2 Algorithmic Approach
1.  **Greedy Construction:** Start with 0 stations. Iteratively add the station that yields the max reduction in total cost (considering installation vs. walking savings).
2.  **Lagrangian Relaxation:** Relax the demand constraints and penalize violations in the objective function. This decomposes the problem into independent knapsack-like problems for each candidate site, providing tight lower bounds for the optimal solution.
3.  **Exact Solution:** Use a solver like Gurobi or CBC. The tight formulation of capacity constraints usually leads to fast convergence.

### 6. Preliminary Insights and Discussion
*   **Capacity vs. Distance:** If $f_j$ (installation cost) is high compared to walking cost, the solution will favor fewer, large-capacity stations (centralized). If $f_j$ is low, the solution will approach a "station in every zone" distributed topology.
*   **Shadow Prices:** The dual variable associated with the capacity constraint of a station $j$ indicates the value of expanding that station's capacity. High shadow prices suggest "bottleneck" stations that should be upgraded.
*   **Fairness:** The current objective minimizes *average* walking distance. This might leave some remote zones with very long walks. A "Minimax" objective (minimize the maximum walking distance) could be added as a secondary constraint for equity.
